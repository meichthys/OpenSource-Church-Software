# Free and OpenSource Church Software

Free and open-source alternatives to paid church software

## Disclaimers

This project *is not* intended to:

- Discourage or diminish the use or effectiveness of great [paid church software](https://churchm.ag/church-management-software/)
- Be a comprehensive list of all open-source church software (See [here](https://github.com/mattrob33/christian-projects) instead)
- Provide the __best__ solution to all church software needs
- Be a guide on how to install/configure each software suggested

This project *is* intended to:

- Provide Free and OpenSource alternatives to paid software
- Demonstrate a 'no-cost' software stack that could theoretically be used in a church plant with very limited financial resources.
- Suggest practical and working church software solutions

Some of the suggested software will...

- Require advanced installation which may necessitate an IT person
- Not be as full featured as paid options
- Be in active development or not actively maintained, and thus may have bugs or 'rough edges'
- Not be specifically designed for churches, but will provide the necessary functionality
